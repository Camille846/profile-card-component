# Frontend Mentor - Profile card component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a solution to the [Profile card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ)

I started this challenge to help me improve my coding skills by creating a responsive profile card component design. 

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this profile card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The profile card component design is a newbie layout. 

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This is a CSS tutorial for Flexbox Layout Module that elped me comprehend flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.
- [Viewport Sized Typography](https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/) - This helped me understanding the use of vw units for the font-size. I really liked this pattern for resposive designs and will use it going forward.
